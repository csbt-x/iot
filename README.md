Welcome to the OpenRemote 3.0 platform; an intuitive user-friendly 100% open source IoT platform. We have our origins in Home Automation
but our 3.0 platform is focused on generic IoT applications and is a completely different stack to any of our 2.x services. As the code
base is 100% open source then the applications are limitless. Here's an architecture overview:

![Architecture 3.0](https://github.com/openremote/Documentation/blob/master/manuscript/figures/architecture-3.jpg)

## Quickstart

You can quickly try the online demo with restricted access, login credentials are `smartcity:smartcity`:

[Online demo](https://demo.openremote.io/manager/?realm=smartcity)

The quickest way to get your own environment with full access is to make use of our docker images (both `amd64` and `arm64` are supported). 
1. Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed (v18+). 
2. Download the docker compose file:
[OpenRemote Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openremote/openremote/master/docker-compose.yml) (Right click 'Save link as...')
3. In a terminal `cd` to where you just saved the compose file and then run:

    `docker-compose -p openremote up`

If all goes well then you should now be able to access the OpenRemote Manager UI at [https://localhost](https://localhost). You will need to accept the self-signed 
certificate, see [here](https://www.technipages.com/google-chrome-bypass-your-connection-is-not-private-message) for details how to do this in Chrome (similar for other browsers).

### Login credentials
Username: admin  
Password: secret

### Not using localhost?
The URL you use to access the system is important, by default keycloak expects it to be `https://localhost` if you are using a VM then you will need to tell keycloak at startup, so if for example you will be accessing using `https://192.168.1.1` then use the following startup command:

BASH: 
```
KEYCLOAK_FRONTEND_URL=https://192.168.1.1/auth docker-compose -p openremote up -d
```
or

CMD:
```
cmd /C "set KEYCLOAK_FRONTEND_URL=https://192.168.1.1/auth && docker-compose -p openremote up -d"
```


## What next
Try creating assets, agents, rules, users, realms, etc. using the Manager UI, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki) for more information, some things to try:

- [Manager UI Guide](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/Demo-Smart-City)
- [Creating an HTTP Agent](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/User-Guide%3A-Connecting-to-a-HTTP-API)
- [Custom Deployment](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/User-Guide%3A-Custom-deployment)
- [Setting up an IDE](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/Developer-Guide%3A-Setting-up-an-IDE)
- [Working on the UI](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/Developer-Guide%3A-Working-on-the-UI)

## Where's the data stored?
Persistent data is stored in a PostgreSQL DB which is stored in the `openremote_postgresql-data` docker volume which is durably stored independently of the running containers (see all with `docker volume ls`).
If you want to create a backup of your installation, just make a copy of this volume.
